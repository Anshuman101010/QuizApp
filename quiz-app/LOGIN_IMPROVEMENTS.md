# Login Page UI/UX Improvements

## Overview
The login page has been significantly enhanced with a modern, professional design featuring an animated background similar to Vanta.js waves effect.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Animated Background
- **Three.js Integration**: Custom animated background using Three.js with WebGL shaders
- **Mouse Interaction**: Background waves respond to mouse movement
- **Performance Optimized**: 60fps animation with proper cleanup
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback to static gradient if Three.js fails

### 2. Enhanced Visual Design
- **Glass Morphism**: Semi-transparent card with backdrop blur
- **Gradient Overlays**: Multiple gradient layers for depth

### 4. Interactive Elements

- **Button Animations**: Scale and shadow effects
- **Icon Integration**: Lucide React icons throughout

### 5. Technical Features
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety
